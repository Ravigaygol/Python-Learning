#Variables Rules
#When naming the variables there are some rules as follows:

#1- A variable name should start with a letter or the underscore character
#2- A variable name cannot start with number
#3- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-Z, 0-9, and _)
#4- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

# Example
#Calculate Area of rectangle

length = 5
width = 10

area = length * width

print('Total area rectangle = {0}'.format(area))
